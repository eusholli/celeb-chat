##Signing up, and deploying to Nodejitsu

###Documentation

The documenation was available on the front page (right under the sign up for free button): https://www.nodejitsu.com/getting-started/

Install the Nodejitsu Package

    npm install jitsu -g (you may need to prefix this with sudo if you're on Mac)

Register via the command line:

    jitsu signup (yes you can sign up via the command line)

You'll get a confirmation email with a command to type in:

    jitsu users confirm [username] [confirmation-guid]

If you've already registered, you can login with:

    jitsu login

After you confirm your email, you can login (the `confirm` command should prompt you to log in).

Change the `subdomain` value in `package.json`, to reflect the url you want to deploy to:

    {
      "name": "nodejs-chat",
      [...],
      "subdomain": "nodejs-chat" <--- this value
    }

now deploy:

    jitsu deploy

And your app should be up on Nodejitsu.
